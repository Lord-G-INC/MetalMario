# Metal Mario has made its way into Super Mario Galaxy 2!
This new Syati module adds a new Power-Up, the Metal Mushroom. Once collected, Mario will transform into Metal Mario (or Luigi into Metal Luigi).
It functions similar to SM64, but also has some new extra features. To learn more, you can watch this overview trailer: https://youtu.be/bd4qGKoaFMQ

## Installing the module
This can be done by simply using SyatiManager and downloading the latest Metal Mario module, then building it.

## Using Metal Mario
To place the Metal Mushroom, add a `MorphItemNeoMetal` object to your stage. To use the electrical charging station, add a `MetalPlayerElectricPad` object. Simple as that!
